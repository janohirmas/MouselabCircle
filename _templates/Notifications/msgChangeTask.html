            <li> Now, your task is to <b> guess what other participants guessed in the same task </b>. </li>
            <li> Participants in a previous online study (with people from different countries)
        guessed the rank of the candidates based on the same information you are going to observe.</li>
            <li> <b>Your task </b>: Guess the rank that most of these previous participants chose for the candidate. </li>

    {{ else }}
            <li> Before, you had to guess what other participants guessed in the same task. </li>
            <li> Now, your task is to <b> guess the actual evaluation of the candidate. </b>  </li>
